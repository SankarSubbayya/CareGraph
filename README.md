# CareGraph

**AI-powered senior care intelligence built with Neo4j + RocketRide AI + GMI Cloud + Bland AI + CrewAI**

## The problem we're solving

Healthcare for older adults is **episodic**: a clinician might see someone every few months, while daily life—mood, symptoms, meals, mobility, and **dozens of possible medication combinations**—unfolds in between. Isolation and chronic disease mean small changes add up quietly; by the time a crisis hits the ER, the story of *what changed and why* is often incomplete.

**For elders**, that gap shows up as **unnoticed side effects**, **unexplained symptoms written off as “just aging,”** and delayed help when something is wrong. **For family caregivers**, it shows up as **constant worry**, uneven check-ins, medical facts trapped in phone calls and text threads, and the fear of missing the one day that mattered.

CareGraph exists to **shrink that blind spot**: an automated daily touchpoint, a **structured memory of care** (who takes what, what was reported, how it connects in the graph), and **early signals** to caregivers and clinicians—so support is **proactive and dignified**, not only reactive after an emergency.

> Built for HackWithBay 2.0 Hackathon — Theme: Building Intelligent, Graph-Powered Applications with Neo4j and RocketRide AI

**Cloud demo:** The app runs on Render at [https://caregraph.onrender.com](https://caregraph.onrender.com). **This is a demo deployment** for exploring the landing page and dashboard without a local setup; use the Quick Start below for full features, your own keys, and development.

## Neo4j and RocketRide AI

**Neo4j** stores the care knowledge graph: seniors, medications, symptoms, conditions, check-ins, alerts, family contacts, doctors, and clinics as nodes, with typed relationships (for example, who takes which drugs, reported symptoms, drug–drug interactions, and symptom-to-medication side-effect links). The FastAPI backend runs **Cypher** queries against Neo4j (Aura in the cloud, or local/Docker) to power the dashboard: live stats, care-network and doctors-network views, drug-interaction and side-effect detection, cross-senior patterns, and doctor recommendations by traversing the graph instead of flat keyword search. For a deeper dive into the graph model, queries, and design, see [NEO4J_ARCHITECTURE.md](NEO4J_ARCHITECTURE.md).

**RocketRide AI** provides **visual pipeline orchestration** for LLM steps. The `pipelines/` **`.pipe`** files define flows (webhook or prompt → **Gemini** → structured responses) for check-in transcript analysis, plain-language drug-interaction explanations, personalized care recommendations from graph context, and condition suggestions from symptom clusters. RocketRide integrates with the app when its server is running; if a pipeline is unavailable, inference can **fall back to GMI Cloud** (see `app/services/rocketride.py` and the RocketRide section later in this README).

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.12+
- [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) (package manager)
- Neo4j Aura account (or local Docker) — [console.neo4j.io](https://console.neo4j.io)
- GMI Cloud API key — [console.gmicloud.ai](https://console.gmicloud.ai)
- Bland AI API key (optional, for voice calls) — [bland.ai](https://www.bland.ai)

### 1. Clone and install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/SankarSubbayya/CareGraph.git
cd CareGraph
uv sync
```

### 2. Configure environment

Copy `.env.example` or create `.env`:

```env
# Neo4j (Aura or local)
NEO4J_URI=neo4j+s://your-instance.databases.neo4j.io
NEO4J_USER=neo4j
NEO4J_PASSWORD=your-password

# GMI Cloud (required for AI features)
GMI_BASE_URL=https://api.gmi-serving.com/v1
GMI_API_KEY=your-gmi-api-key
GMI_MODEL=Qwen/Qwen3-235B-A22B-Instruct-2507-FP8

# Bland AI (optional, for voice calls)
BLAND_API_KEY=your-bland-api-key

# RocketRide AI (optional, for pipeline orchestration)
ROCKETRIDE_URI=http://localhost:5565
ROCKETRIDE_APIKEY=

# App
BASE_URL=http://localhost:8000
SKIP_AUTH=true
```

**Using local Neo4j instead of Aura:**
```bash
docker run -d --name neo4j -p 7474:7474 -p 7687:7687 \
  -e NEO4J_AUTH=neo4j/password neo4j:5
```
Then set `NEO4J_URI=bolt://localhost:7687` and `NEO4J_PASSWORD=password`.

### 3. Seed demo data and start

```bash
# Start the server
uv run python main.py

# In another terminal — seed demo data
uv run python scripts/seed_data.py     # 4 seniors, medications, check-ins, alerts
uv run python scripts/seed_doctors.py  # 159 doctors, 38 clinics
```

### 4. Open in browser

| URL | Page |
|-----|------|
| http://localhost:8000 | Landing page |
| http://localhost:8000/dashboard | Full dashboard |

### 5. Run tests

```bash
uv run python -m pytest tests/ -v
```

## What CareGraph Does

```
1. Bland AI calls the senior every morning
2. Voice agent asks about mood, medications, symptoms, doctor needs
3. Transcript is analyzed → symptoms extracted → stored in Neo4j graph
4. Graph detects drug interactions, side effect matches, condition suggestions
5. GMI Cloud (Qwen3-235B) generates care plans from graph data
6. Alerts notify family members based on severity
```

### Example: Dorothy reports dizziness

```
Dorothy TAKES Lisinopril
Dorothy REPORTED dizziness
Lisinopril HAS_SIDE_EFFECT dizziness
→ Neo4j connects the dots automatically
→ Qwen3-235B explains: "Dizziness may be a side effect of Lisinopril. Discuss with doctor."
→ Family gets notified
```
